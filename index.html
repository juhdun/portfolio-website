    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section class="about-section">
 <p>
    I’m a self-taught photographer and designer who loves turning ideas into visuals that feel lived-in, human, and real. 
    My work sits somewhere between lifestyle and product — blending fashion, objects, cars, and environments into stories 
    brands can use to communicate who they are.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="about-section">
 <p>
    I started building my portfolio on Instagram, where I quickly grew an audience through experimental projects and visual briefs. 
    Since then, businesses and creatives have reached out to collaborate, and I’ve begun shaping my work into a freelance practice — 
    creating imagery, brand visuals, and mockups that help products exist beyond the screen.
  </p></section>

<section class="about-section">
<p>
    Outside of the studio and behind the camera, I’ve spent years working in construction and building maintenance. 
    That background taught me how things are made, how spaces function, and how to pay attention to details that often 
    get overlooked. It’s also led me toward building surveying, where technical problem-solving meets the physical world.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="about-section">
    <p>
    Across everything I do, I’m driven by curiosity, craftsmanship, and the challenge of making things that resonate — 
    from brand stories to buildings to photographs.
